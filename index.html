    <h2>1946-ENIAC</h2>
    <img src="ENIAC.jpg"<br>
<p>The ENIAC was built at the University of Pennsylvania by
   John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly and stands for
   Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. The ENAIC was
   the first large-scale computer to run at electronic speed
    without being slowed by any mechanical parts. For a decade,
    until a 1955 lightning strike, ENIAC may have run more
    calculations than all mankind had done up to that point.
    ENIAC glowed with an unprecedented 18,000 vacuum tubes.
    Engineers created strict circuit design guidelines to
    maximize reliability. They ran extensive tests on
    components and avoided pushing them to their limits,
    which included operating vacuum tubes well below their
    maximum voltages to prolong their life.</p>
